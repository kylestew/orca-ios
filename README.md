**Each letter of the alphabet is an operation**, lowercase letters typically operate on bang(`*`), uppercase letters operate on each frame. Bangs can be generated by various operations, such as `E` colliding with a `0`, see the [bang.orca](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca/blob/master/examples/bang.orca) example.
